EchoLite is an FPGA-based distance measurement system implemented on the Intel DE10-Lite development board, powered by the Altera MAX 10 FPGA.

# Description
EchoLite is an FPGA-based distance measurement system implemented on the Intel DE10-Lite development board, powered by the Altera MAX 10 FPGA. It uses the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to detect distances by measuring the time delay between pulse emission and echo reception—all done in VHDL.
